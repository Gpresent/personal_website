                    <p>Hi, I'm Cole Broberg. I grew up in Dallas, TX, in a neighborhood called Lakewood (it is, indeed,
                        by a
                        lake). I took a liking to STEM very early on, getting involved with TMSCA Math Team in fourth
                        grade and
                        winning the school-wide math competition every year. In middle school, my experience with Math
                        Team
                        reached its height under a great coach and mentor of mine, Juan Fernandez. <br><br>
                        By the time I entered high school, while I chose to enter the International Baccalaureate
                        program, I knew
                        that I wanted to work in the STEM world. My experience with coding was minimal until I hit high
                        school, when
                        (in 10th grade) I took AP Computer Science. The class opened my eyes to the possibilities
                        offered by the
                        field of computer science and the infinite creativity that coding can unleash. My school,
                        Woodrow Wilson
                        High School, didn't offer any prograssion beyond AP Comp Sci, but I was certain that I wanted to
                        pursue it
                        in university. <br><br>
                        As a Engineering Honors student at Texas A&M, I've now taken Computer Science classes from the
                        100 to the
                        400 level, become a peer teacher for intro to C++, Discrete Mathematics, and Data Sctructures
                        and
                        Algorithms, begun research on graph algorithms with professor Tim Davis, and found many
                        wonderful friends
                        and comrades along the way. <br><br>
                        I'm now a junior in Computer Science, the bug (pun intended) to get industry experience is
                        pulling tighly at
                        me, and I'm itching to see how the skills I've honed in the classroom and out of it will allow
                        me to thrive
                        in
                        the workforce. I have three semesters remaining before graduation from A&M, and I'm planning on
                        rounding out
                        the next two years with an internship and co-op. My Computer Science journey is just beginning,
                        and there's
                        always more to learn. I'm looking forward to every moment of it.</p>
