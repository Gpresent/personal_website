          <p>Hi, I'm Cole Broberg. I grew up in Dallas, TX, in a neighborhood called Lakewood (it is, indeed, by a
            lake). I didn't do any development until I hit high school, when in 10th grade I took AP Computer Science.
            The class opened my eyes to the possibilities offered by the field of computer science and the infinite
            creativity that coding can unleash. My school didn't offer any prograssion in computer science beyond AP
            Comp Sci, but I knew that I wanted to pursue it in university. <br><br>
            As a Engineering Honors student at Texas A&M, I've now taken Computer Science classes from the 100 to the
            400 level, become a peer teacher for intro to C++, Discrete Mathematics, and Data Sctructures and
            Algorithms,
            begun research on graph algorithms with professor Tim Davis, and found many wonderful friends and comrades
            along the way. <br><br>
            As a junior in Computer Science, the bug (pun intended) to get industry experience is pulling tighly at me,
            and I'm itching to see how the skills I've honed in the classroom and out of it will allow me to thrive in
            the workforce. My Computer Science journey is just beginning, and there's always more to learn. I'm looking
            forward to every moment of it.</p>
